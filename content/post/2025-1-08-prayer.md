o, o, oh god 
the body yawns open into a well  
maw dripping and wet
helpless, hungry, desirous
<br/>

**”aliveness, come alive.”**  
<br/>

your mothers told you in their silence:  
<br/>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *there is a sea beneath the sea*  
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *just you wait (giggles)*  
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *longing tastes so salty* 
<br/>

**I want but I can’t have!**  
<br/>
your voice sounds shrill, grating
submissive, baby-like, needy 
legs tense open, stupid surrender 
curling knees up, tail curled  

pour me open, trembling vase  
the waterfall is a neck thrown back
<br/>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp*ever-present body of water*  
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *waiting to consume you*  
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *rolling, crashing, crushing*
<br/>

**”aliveness, come alive.”**  
<br/>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp { 
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp a note: licks of lover’s spit. 
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You will destroy me. 
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You will take everything from me. 
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And I will give it to you. Willingly. 
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Wantonly. 
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp } 
<br/>

fight futile and fair
throw punches at stormy sea 
dominate the domination  
all hail the dominion of life  
<br/>

you see:  
lineages of mothers warn me  
they too know the helplessness  
hunger for soul in their wombs 
<br/>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *it is a terrible kind of surrender*
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp*don’t worry darling*
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp*you’ll learn to love it*
<br/>

**"aliveness, come alive."** 
<br/>

hollowed out, a vessel to pour 
An ocean of tears. 
Salt water run through 
veins and tributaries of aliveness
<br/>
**hail mary, full of grace** 
<br/>
guide me through the **seven gates of intimacy** 
<br/>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp*gate one:* submitting
<br/>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp*gate two:* falling 
<br/>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp*gate three:* dissolving 
<br/>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp*gate four:* tearing
<br/> 
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp*gate five:* devouring 
<br/>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp*gate six:*  nothing is left. 
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbspdust to dust. 
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbspempty plate licked saliva clean.

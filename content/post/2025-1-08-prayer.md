***

o, o, oh god 
the body yawns open into a well  
maw dripping and wet
helpless, hungry, desirous
<br/>
**”aliveness, come alive.”**  
  <br/>
  <br/>
your mothers told you in their silence:  
<br/>
		*there is a sea beneath the sea*  
		*just you wait (giggles)*  
		*longing tastes so salty* 

**I want but I can’t have!**  
<br/>
your voice sounds shrill, grating
submissive, baby-like, needy 
legs tense open, stupid surrender 
curling knees up, tail curled  
pour me open, trembling vase  
the waterfall is a neck thrown back
<br/>
<br/>

		*ever-present body of water*  
		*waiting to consume you*  
		*rolling, crashing, crushing*

  <br/>
  <br/>

**”aliveness, come alive.”**  
  

  <br/>
<br/>
				{ a note: licks of lover’s spit. 
				<br/>
				You will destroy me. 
				You will take everything from me. 
				And I will give it to you. Willingly. 
				Wantonly. 
				<br/>
				} 
<br/>
<br/>
  
fight futile and fair
throw punches at stormy sea 
dominate the domination  
all hail the dominion of life  
<br/>
you see:  
lineages of mothers warn me  
they too know the helplessness  
hunger for soul in their wombs 
<br/>


		*it is a terrible kind of surrender*
		*don’t worry darling*
		*you’ll learn to love it*


<br/>
<br/>

**"aliveness, come alive."** 
<br/>
hollowed out, a vessel to pour 
An ocean of tears. 
Salt water run through 
veins and tributaries of aliveness
<br/>

**hail mary, full of grace** 
<br/>
<br/>

guide me through the **seven gates of intimacy** 

  
<br/>

*gate one:* submitting

  <br/>

	*gate two:* falling 

  <br/>

		*gate three:* dissolving 

  <br/>

			*gate four:* tearing
<br/>
  

				*gate five:* devouring

  
<br/>
					*gate six:* nothing is left. dust to dust. empty plate licked saliva clean. 

  
<br/>
						*gate seven:*

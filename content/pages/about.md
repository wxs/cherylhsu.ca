## **This is a container for the cultivation of a [“soul’s calling”](https://cherylhsu.ca/post/2020-11-06-commitment-to-calling/).** 


### Who is Cheryl? 

Cheryl is **transversal designer,** braiding living root bridges of wholeness and intimacy in the time between worlds. (see: [Imaginal Transitions](https://weallcanada.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Toronto-Imaginal-Transitions-v1.0.pdf), [Thinking Transversally](https://youtu.be/fnpDP71uI9A?si=Ss8aVuVKzouH3afU))

Cheryl is a **soul-maker**, cultivating sanctuaries of post-tragic innocence and imagination. (see: [alchemical soul-making](https://youtu.be/lcK-fu6BtZ0?si=3toKpfIJ5xEQZ-d-)) 

Cheryl is a **space-holder** and **gap-diver** for intersubjective unfoldment and creativity. (see: [Collective Presencing](https://cherylhsu.ca/tags/collectivepresencing/))

Cheryl is a **spiritual activist**, devoted to the democratization of mystical participation. (see: [Church of the Intimate Web](https://publish.obsidian.md/intimateweb/The+Logos+Garden))

Cheryl is an **anthropologist**-**cartographer** of *collective wisdom *and *consciousness mutation*, experimenting with post-dual research methods and intersubjective ethnography to study numinous coherence. (see: [Participation Mystique](https://youtu.be/lcK-fu6BtZ0?si=VPFj7J3G2WuhQmP6))

Cheryl is a **speculative philosopher** of *toroidal cosmologies*, the uncanny becomings that play in the intimate membranes between bodies in space. (see: [Toroidal Bodies](https://youtu.be/mKSEh06X8hI?si=OPoUpfuqBQlslnuJ))

Cheryl is a **black hole**.

This is a container for the cultivation of a [“soul’s calling”](https://cherylhsu.ca/post/2020-11-06-commitment-to-calling/). 

I’ve called it “self-directed masters” as a pithy way of naming a sovereign space for the open-ended exploration of ideas and phenomena that intrigue, implicate, and scandalize me. 

As a designer, I seek to create spaces for collective emergence. In order to do so, I believe that we have to find ways to hospice with tenderness what needs to collapse and die, so that it may compost into potential for new life. 

I also believe that we can have a joyful, sensual relationship with Mystery -- and we can embrace *wonder* and awe in how the Unknown makes our minds pause, our hearts race, and our bodies tremble. Perhaps this is a vibe we can all tune into. This might be how we dance with potentialities that are greater than what we can possibly imagine.

#### **This is a container for the cultivation of a [“soul’s calling”](https://cherylhsu.ca/post/2020-11-06-commitment-to-calling/).** 

I’ve called it **“self-directed masters”** as a pithy way of naming a sovereign space, a[ carrier bag](https://cherylhsu.ca/post/2020-12-02-carrier-bag-of-gatherings/), for the open current of ideas and phenomena that intrigue, implicate, scandalize and transform me. 

As a designer, I seek to create spaces for [collective emergence](https://cherylhsu.ca/post/2020-11-11-first-mover/) and fluid becoming. In order to do so, I believe that we have to find ways to hospice with tenderness what needs to collapse and die, so that it may compost into potential for new life. 

The **Dragons we design with** are the animated imaginal -- they are the ghosts and thick traumas of our ancestors, the playful spirits of rivers and cats, the diaphanous potentials of our visions, the divinity of our dreams. These magical creatures and monsters lurk in the shadows of the dark forest, made thicker and more dangerous when we keep our eyes on the map, and shine a flashlight on the territory. The dragons represent the mysteries and complexities that are irreducible in each of us, in our relationships with others, and the cosmos. 

Rather than avoiding dragons, I believe that we can have a joyful, sensual, and sacred relationship with Mystery. We can embrace *wonder* and awe in how the Unknown makes our minds pause, our hearts race, and our bodies tremble. Perhaps this is a vibe, a [strange attractor](https://cherylhsu.ca/post/2020-11-18-becoming-strange-attractor/), we can all tune into. This might be how we flow and dance with potentialities that are greater than what we can possibly imagine.

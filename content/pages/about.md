This is a container for the cultivation of a [“soul’s calling”](https://cherylhsu.ca/post/2020-11-06-commitment-to-calling/). 

I’ve called it “self-directed masters” as a pithy way of naming a sovereign space, a[ carrier bag](https://cherylhsu.ca/post/2020-12-02-carrier-bag-of-gatherings/), for the open current of ideas and phenomena that intrigue, implicate, scandalize and transform me. 

As a designer, I seek to create spaces for [collective emergence](https://cherylhsu.ca/post/2020-11-11-first-mover/) and fluid becoming. In order to do so, I believe that we have to find ways to hospice with tenderness what needs to collapse and die, so that it may compost into potential for new life. 

I also believe that we can have a joyful, sensual relationship with Mystery, where we embrace *wonder* and awe in how the Unknown makes our minds pause, our hearts race, and our bodies tremble. Perhaps this is a vibe, a [strange attractor](https://cherylhsu.ca/post/2020-11-18-becoming-strange-attractor/), we can all tune into. This might be how we flow and dance with potentialities that are greater than what we can possibly imagine.
